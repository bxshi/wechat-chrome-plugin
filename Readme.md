# Wechat Chrome Plugin

---

This is a plugin for [Wechat web version](https://web.wechatapp.com/), which could add desktop notification for you.

That means, when you got new message, you will get a notification, and will not likely miss it!

**How to use it**

* Download the `wechat-chrome-plugin.crx` file
* Drag&Drop it into Chrome
* No more Steps

This plugin could:

* Popup a desktop notification when you got new messages

* Click on notification, it will bring you to wechat page.

Still, this is a beta one, so only the basic function is done, and the following is something I want to add in the future:

* Show user's icon at notification (Still not figure out how to implementation it)

* Show user's message at notification (Hmm, not likely :( )


**Feel free to help me improve it or just leave some new needs here!**
